        I looked down at the board. "The <strong>point</strong> isn't to win?" I asked. "The
        point," <span>Bredon</span> said grandly, "is to <ul>play</ul> a <em></em>beautiful</em> game." He lifted
        his hands and shrugged, his face breaking into a beautific smile. "Why
        would I want to win anything other than a beautiful game?"

            <h2>The SS Minow</h2>

	</article>
              <p>Just sit right back and you'll hear a tale,
a tale of a fateful trip.
That started from this tropic port,
aboard this tiny ship.

The mate was a mighty sailing man,
the skipper brave and sure.
Five passengers set sail that day,
for a three hour tour.
a three hour tour.

            <h2>Tropical Island Nest</h2>
            <p>The weather started getting rough,
the tiny ship was tossed.
If not for the courage of the fearless crew,
the Minnow would be lost,
the Minnow would be lost.
</p>
<p>
The ship took ground on the shore of this
uncharted desert isle,
with Giligan, the skipper too,
The millionaire, and his wife,
The movie star,
The professor, and MaryAnn,
here on Gilligan's Isle.

              <h3>A Tale of Shipwreck</h3>
              <p>
So this is the tale of our castaways,
they're here for a long, long time.
They'll have to make the best of things,
it's an uphill climb.

The first mate, and his skipper too,
will do their very best
to make the others comfortable
in this tropic island nest.

No Phones, No lights, No Motorcars,
Not a single luxury.
Like Robinson Crusoe
It's primitive as can be.

So join us here each week, my friend,
you're sure to get a smile,
from seven stranded castaways,
Here on Gilligan's Isle!
